# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Prerequisites
We'll need the following to get started:

   - Expo Go installed on a Android mobile device
   - Node.js (LTS version) installed
   - VS Code or any other preferred code editor or IDE installed
   - A macOS, Linux, or Windows (PowerShell and WSL2) with a terminal window open

2. Open project in VS Code
   - Clone project: [https://github.com/Gabrielx47/SkinMatch.git](https://github.com/Gabrielx47/SkinMatch.git)
   - Open the project folder in VS Code

4. Install dependencies
   Access the project folder directory via the command line and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
7. Start the web app
   ```bash
    npx expo start --web
   ```
8. Start the mobile app
   - Scan the QR Code present on the terminal using Expo Go. The QR Code is generated when you run the command ```npx expo start``` or ```npx expo start --web```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
